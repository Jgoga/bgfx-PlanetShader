bgfx-PlanetShader
==============

Written by Benjamin Quach

This is a program designed to render a planet using GLSL shaders. It contains a ton of code to bootstrap a project with a low level library such as bgfx as well. Uses the bgfx renderer for mesh rendering, and SDL for windowing.
Feel free to steal makefile if you don't use GENIe with bgfx and just want to compile for linux.
